# Titanic-Classification-Logistic-Regression-From-Scratch
Multivariable logistic regression with single neuron model for titanic survival predictions coded both with SciKitLearn and with math from scratch


## Motivation:
After taking Andrew Ng's first machine learning course, I wanted to test my knowledge on an independent project using what I learned.

## Results:
I was able to get the same result of around 75% with both sklearn and from scratch with math, confirming that my implimentation from scratch is accurate. When submitting to kaggle, my goal was to achieve an accuracy of higher than 70% as I was only using a single neuron. 

### From Scratch results
Because this was a kaggle competition, I didn't have access to the labels for the testing dataset, so I split the training dataset 80-20 to test my model before submission.
